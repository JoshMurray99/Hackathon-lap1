Hangman Game:

How to play:
-To play, open the project folder and run npm install, then type npm start.
-You'll then be prompted to guess the letters until you run out of lives (starting with 12 lives).
-You can guess the entire word in one go but if you get it wrong the game will be over!

I'm yet to add an actual visualisation of the hangman!
