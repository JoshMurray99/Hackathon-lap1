# Hangman Game

## How to play:
1. To play, open the project folder and run `npm install`, then type `npm start`.
2. You'll then be prompted to guess the letters until you run out of lives (starting with 12 lives).
3. You can guess the entire word in one go, but if you get it wrong, the game will be over!

Note: I'm yet to add an actual visualization of the hangman!
